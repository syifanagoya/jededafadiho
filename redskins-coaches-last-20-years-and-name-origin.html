Before that, Rivera held coaching duty at Carolina Panthers from 2011 to 2019.</p><p>The once Redskins were now Washington Football Team.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=redskins-coaches-for-the-last-20-years></span>Redskins Coaches for the last 20 years<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Bill Callahan</strong></td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jay Gruden</strong></td><td>2014-2019</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mike Shanahan</strong></td><td>2010-2013</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jim Zorn</strong></td><td>2008-2009</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Joe Gibbs</strong></td><td>2004-2007</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Steve Spurrier</strong></td><td>2002-2003</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marty Schottenheimer</strong></td><td>2001</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terry Robiskie</strong></td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norv Turner</strong></td><td>1994-2000</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=who-was-the-first-coach-of-t><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-the-first-coach-of-the-washington-redskins></span> Who Was The First Coach Of The Washington Redskins?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Washington Redskins first coach was<strong> Ray Flaherty</strong>. He has the <strong>best winning percentage of .720</strong> among the Washington coaches.</p><p>Before Ray, only three people coached the franchise: Lud Wray, Lone Star Dietz, and Eddie Casey.</p><p>Wray was the first-ever coach of the team. He took the job in 1932 when the team was called Boston Braves.</p><p>Dietz and Casey coached in the Boston Redskins era from 1933 to 1935.</p><p>When Flaherty was recruited to take charge of the team in 1936, they were still called the Boston Redskins. They relocated from Boston to Washington, D.C. in 1937 and started playing under the name Washington Redskins.</p><p>In the first year, Ray helped the team win the division title. He missed the chance to live the championship in 1936 as Green Bay Packers thrashed them 21-6.</p><p>However, his hard work paid off as he won three more (1937, 1940, and 1942) during his seven-year tenure with the organization.&nbsp;The two NFL Championships in 1937 and 1942 were the cherry on top.</p><p>Ray coached the team for 78 games and won 54 while losing 21. His playoff record is 2-2.</p><p>The individual used the screen pass technique in 1937 and is hailed for the offensive innovation.</p><h2 id=how-did-redskins-get-their-n><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-redskins-get-their-name></span> How Did Redskins Get Their Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Origin of the Washington Redskins name dates back to <strong>1937</strong> when the owner <strong>George Preston Marshall left Boston </strong>and moved to <strong>Washington, D.C</strong>.</p><p>Before the relocation, they played at Fenway Park and were known as the ‘Boston Redskins.’</p><p>Likewise, this was not their first change of name or location. Prior to that, they fielded at Braves Field and were called ‘Boston Braves.’</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-franchises-origin-and-the-name-%e2%80%98redskins></span>The franchise’s origin and the name ‘Redskins’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Washington Redskins name origin was a sequel orchestrated by Marshall in 1937. Lack of local support forced them to change the city.</p><p>The first change saw them drop the ‘Braves’ and attain ‘Redskins.’</p><p>It was Marshall’s decision to take the Redskins and leave the Braves. When they were in Boston, the city had a baseball team called ‘Boston Braves.’</p><p>The decision was logical and necessary as two sports teams with the same name created confusion.</p><p>But, why did they choose ‘Redskins’ instead of other native names? There are many theories behind the decision.</p><p>Many presume that the hiring of William Henry “Lone Star” Dietz, who is believed to belong to Sioux, and the presence of Indian players in the team rung the owner’s head to come up with the idea.</p><p>The primary notion was to honor the tribal communities and gain fan support by resonating with them through sentimental values.</p><p>This is the most famous theory of all.</p><p>Another theory claims that George was a fan of ‘Indian football’ and wanted to bring it to the NFL. He wanted his team to adopt passing and trick plays like the Native American teams.</p><p>To fulfill that, he hired Dietz, who coached at the Haskell Indian Institute. He also brought the Native American connection by adding an Indian head as the team’s emblem. The uniform also reflected the idea.</p><h2 id=are-the-washington-commander><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-the-washington-commanders-changing-their-name></span> Are The Washington Commanders Changing Their Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Washington Commanders may change their name as the <strong>trademark appeal for ‘Commanders’</strong> was <strong>denied</strong> on 18th May 2023.</p><p>Per The&nbsp;Washington Post, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cited “a likelihood of confusion” as the primary reason for the refusal. They claim that it appears and sounds too similar to such other names.</p><p>The “Commanders’ Classic” between Army and Air Force and other similar names may often be mis-referenced and misrepresented in the market, which can cause bigger problems.</p><p>Likewise, Martin McCaulay is a trademark holder for names like Washington Wolf Commanders and Washington Space Commanders, which makes the matter trickier for the franchise.</p><p>A trademark attorney and the founder of the D.C. firm Gerben Perrott, Josh Gerben said, “Would the average football consumer think that the Washington Commanders is somehow related to the Commanders’ Classic game at the college level? I think that’s a huge stretch, and I think that that would be the crux of their argument to the USPTO.”</p><p>They got a three-month period to make their case about the team name. It should be ending on 18th August.</p><p>In the midst of everything, the NBA legend, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, a part-owner of the Commanders, hinted at the possibility of a team name change in The Today Show.</p><p>Some possible nicknames for the franchise that may ring right are Majors, Redtails, Redhogs, Pigskins, Brigade, and Armada.</p><h2 id=redskins-petition-2023><span class=ez-toc-section id=redskins-petition-2023></span> Redskins Petition 2023<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Washington Redskins name change petition started on <strong>21st June 2023 by Daniel Fazzolare </strong>in Change.org. It has gained over <strong>48,000 signatures</strong>.</p><p>The petition is called “Change The Washington Commanders back to The Washington Redskins” and is a work of the Native American Guardian Association (NAGA).</p><p>Washington Commanders name change petition is an effort of fans to pressurize the owner and management to consider putting back “Redskins.”</p><p>It details the importance of this particular name and how people are connected with the team via that.</p><p>The petitioner writes, “It was never intended as a derogatory or offensive term but as a symbol of respect and admiration. Changing the name abruptly disregards the positive legacy that the Redskins name has built over the years and disorients the passionate fans.”</p><p>He further points out how “Commanders” fails to capture the historical and cultural essence. He appeals to bring back the old name and make it a symbol of Native American heritage.</p><h2 id=how-do-native-americans-feel><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-native-americans-feel-about-washington-redskins></span> How Do Native Americans Feel About Washington Redskins?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Native Americans feel <strong>unhappy and offended </strong>about the Washington Redskins name. <strong>57% of Native Americans</strong> from a study feel deeply insulted.</p><p>The debate about the word ‘Redskins’ and its cultural trauma and inappropriate use has ignited a large controversy in the past.</p><p>The Native American names and mascots used in sports and other areas had become a core focus. Different studies have been done and various public polls have been carried out.</p><p>Per the 2016 Washington Post Poll, 90% of respondents were not bothered by the name. It recorded the response of 504 people.</p><p>It states that 7 in 10 did not find the term disrespectful towards Indians.</p><p>Another 2019 survey claimed that most people feel “proud” of the word Washington Redskins.</p><p>‘Proud’ received the most response when asked to select the word describing their feelings about the Redskins. The pool contained words like satisfied, content, disappointed, annoyed, indifferent, and proud,&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-native-americans-offended-by-washington-redskins></span>Are Native Americans offended by Washington Redskins?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Native Americans are offended by the Washington Redskins name as 67% of people engaged in native or tribal cultures are against it.</p><p>Per the UC Berkeley Study, 49% of self-identified Native Americans find it offensive.</p><p>There were 1,000 self-identified adult Native Americans in the study.</p><h2 id=why-did-the-redskins-change><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-the-redskins-change-their-name></span> Why Did The Redskins Change Their Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Redskins changed their name in 2020 because of mass pressure from Native Americans. They dropped the 87-year-old name.</p><p>The primary sponsors Pepsi, FedEx, Nike, and Bank of America were unhappy about the backlash the franchise was receiving from the general public. They also pushed the team to resolve the matter.</p><p>The George Floyd case, fueled by racial justice and discrimination, and the Native American mascot controversy led the way to dismiss racially inappropriate subjects from sports.</p><p>The derogatory and insult portrayed by the inappropriate use of native figures, images, and names was the main concern for many activists.</p><p>The management and owners decided to retire the name and removed their logo and mascot.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-the-washington-redskins-change-their-name></span>When Did The Washington Redskins Change Their Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Washington Redskins got rid of ‘Redskins’ in 2020 following nationwide pressure. They played the 2020 and 2021 seasons as Washington Football Team.</p><p>The team got a rebranding in 2022 and the name was changed to ‘Washington Commanders.’</p><p>They got new sets of uniforms, a new emblem, and a fight song. They revised the lyrics as ‘Hail to the Commanders.’</p><p>The Commanders unveiled a new mascot called Major Tuddy, a pig mascot, in January 2023. It is a large anthropomorphic pig in a combat helmet and team attire.</p><h2 id=washington-redskins-dream-te><span class=ez-toc-section id=washington-redskins-dream-team></span> Washington Redskins Dream Team<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Washington Redskins Dream Team is the nickname given to the roster from the<strong> 2000 campaign. </strong>The squad was built on a <strong>$100 million</strong> budget.</p><p>It all started in the 1999 NFL Draft when general manager Charlie Casserly pulled out the most insane trade in history. He offered the #5 pick to New Orleans Saints in exchange for all their picks from 1999 plus a first and third-round selection in the 2000 draft.</p><p>Soon after the draft, Dan Snyder purchased the team. Unfortunately, Casserly left the office and Vinny Cerrato was handed the manager role.</p><p>The 1999 season turned out to be exceptional for Snyder and the team as they were 10-6 and won the NFC East division. They defeated Detroit Lions in Wild Card Playoffs 27-13.</p><p>However, they blew a 13-point lead in Divisional Playoffs and lost 14-13 to Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-2000-season></span>The 2000 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Heading into the offseason, the owner and the manager orchestrated some big moves.</p><p>They signed Jeff George, Adrian Murrell, Bruce Smith, Deion Sanders, and Mark Carrier through free agency.</p><p>In the 2000 draft, they got the 3rd overall pick from the San Francisco 49ers while handing them the 12th, 24th, 119th, and 154th choices. The Redskins took LB LaVar Arrington and OT Chris Samuels as the No. 2 and No. 3 picks.</p><p>Both were excellent for Penn State and Alabama in their collegiate career and had immense potential.</p><p>Head Coach Norv Turner already had quality and proven names like Brad Johnson, Stephen Davis, Stephen Alexander, Irving Fryer, Tre Johnson, Skip Hicks, James Trash, and others. On paper, it was a team made for the championship run.</p><p>But, in reality, the pieces of the puzzle misfired. Many veterans and seasoned names underperformed and the team lingered with injuries.</p><p>It was nowhere close to the caliber from the past year.&nbsp;They fired Tuner mid-season and promoted offensive coordinator Terry Robiskie as the head coach.</p><p>They were 8-8 that year and placed 3rd in the NFC East. They failed to qualify for the playoffs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqVmcCstc2sZJynkZi1pr%2BMpZisrF1nfW7FxJqprGWRo7FuusCmnGanop60qrqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
