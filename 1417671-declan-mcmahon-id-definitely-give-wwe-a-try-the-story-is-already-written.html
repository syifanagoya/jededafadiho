Declan McMahon, the son of Shane, accompanied his father for his match at WrestleMania 32. He also appeared in the front row at WWE Fastlane.
Speaking on Developmentally Speaking, Declan McMahon was asked whether he has thought about getting in the ring or working backstage.
“I think there’s obviously, thanking the lord above,” Declan McMahon said. “But there’s always a time and a place for everything."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think God has a time and place for everything. However, with that being said, I think I would probably give wrestling a try. I’ve always wanted to do, if I could only do one match, I tell my grandpa and my dad, I would want to do a match with my two brothers in a triple threat match. Probably Hell in a Cell, maybe jump off some cool sh*t. But I think I would definitely consider giving wrestling a try.</p><p>“In playing football and in watching what goes on behind the scenes with WWE, you really get to see how it becomes almost like you’re writing a story, like you’re projecting a movie. I think in a way that you’re almost conducting an orchestra in the sense that there are so many moving parts. It’s almost like solving a puzzle. I think that would also be really, really cool. But obviously I’m committed to football right now. I’m gonna get my college degree in a couple years. So I’m kind of just letting that pass, and then we’ll see. Got a lot more workouts and got to take a couple more bumps before I could get in there, but I think I would definitely give it a try.”</p><h2 id=h-declan-mcmahon-says-he-s-the-best-fit-for-wwe>Declan McMahon Says He’s The Best Fit For WWE</h2><p>Declan McMahon was also asked to name who would be more likely to get in the business out of him, his brothers, and his cousins. He named himself and noted that the story is already written.</p><p>“Probably me. I mean the story’s already written, right? The rightful heir, the good-looking, the one who looks like Vince, right,” Declan McMahon said. “So I think in the sense that you could play off the WrestleMania 20, like I posted on Twitter. You could play that off and just show that the new generation McMahon. has arrived. So I think in that sense, I would. But we have such a great family, and we’re all so supportive of each other. I think really any of us could potentially want to do it. I know Aurora, Paul’s oldest daughter, Triple H’s oldest daughter, she’s always talked about wanting to do it. But in having my dad and my grandpa’s ego, I think I’d be the best.&nbsp;</p><p>The full interview can be seen below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbm9vYWKxpq%2FLmqVmpZOirqm7zWagnWWUmrOqusitnKWxXZy2t7GMsK6eZZFiwbPFjK2fnmWjqbyzxYyiqmaZnKeyorDYZq6roaSpsq8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
