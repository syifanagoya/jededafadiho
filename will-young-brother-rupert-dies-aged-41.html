Chatting on Bryony Gordon's podcast, he explained: "Now, with twins, they'll wrap them up together, but then they didn't. It was pretty heavy. We came to life together and then got pneumonia and was very ill."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bf8d449cb945-will-young-rupert-6-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMeD17jj3QKd data-wc=8><strong>Rupert's cause of death has not been confirmed</strong></p><p id=eGF6Qbm0nGOJ data-wc=43>Speaking about leaving&nbsp;because of his PTSD, he continued: "I was really ill.

I had an album out, I was in a film and I was having a great time professionally. I had to drive past the train station, and I knew that he’d been there for a day, just drinking. But I knew I had to leave him alone. That was tough, of course it was, but you have to get on. And in that respect being so involved in work was a great thing."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
