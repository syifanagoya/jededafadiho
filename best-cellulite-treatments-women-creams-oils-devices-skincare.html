Cellulite is a tough subject. Nearly all of us have it — 93% of women, in fact — but we often feel too embarrassed to talk about it or let it peek out of our clothing. There is certainly no shame in having it, but there’s also no shame in wanting to get rid of it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nearly all of us have it —&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>93% of women</a>, in fact — but we often feel too embarrassed to talk about it or let it peek out of our clothing. There is certainly no shame in having it, but there’s also no shame in wanting to get rid of it.</p><p>While cellulite is said to be physically harmless, it can be mentally taxing if you feel insecure about it. Diet and exercise could potentially help, but it’s not just about body fat. Cellulite tends to be pretty stubborn, so kicking it to the curb can require some research — and some top-tier products.</p><h2>What Is Cellulite?</h2><p>Dr. Dendy Engelman explained this succinctly to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Healthy</a>: “Cellulite is enlarged packets of body fat deep beneath the skin pushed against the vertical connective tissue that surrounds fat cells.”</p><h2>What Is the Cause of Cellulite?</h2><p>Think about stuffing a pillow with cotton. When there’s too much cotton or it’s not evenly distributed, the outside of the pillow can look lumpy or uneven. Cellulite is similar. “When the fat cells expand,” Dr. Engelman explained, “it limits the space under the skin and puts pressure on the connective tissue. The pressure forces the fat against the top layers and creates the dimpled look.” This doesn’t happen because you gained weight necessarily. Cellulite can actually be genetic, so women of any size can get it!</p><h2>Where Does Cellulite Form?</h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Healthline</a>, the most common parts of the body that get cellulite are the hips, thighs, abdomen, buttocks and breasts. Men can get it too, but it’s much more common on women.</p><h2>What Are the Risk Factors for Developing Cellulite?</h2><p>Again, genetics and hormones play a big role here, as does age — so you’re not necessarily doing anything wrong if you start to develop cellulite. In general, however, an unhealthy diet, slow metabolism, a lack of physical activity and dehydration could be risk factors too, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>WebMD</a>.</p><h2>What Should You Look for in Cellulite Treatments?</h2><p>Not all cellulite-reducing products are as miraculous as they seem. Great ingredients to look for include caffeine, aminophylline, theophylline and retinol, also according to WebMD.</p><h2>How We Found the Best Cellulite Treatments</h2><p>Having done our research on the causes of cellulite and certain ingredients to look for, we searched the web for products that we knew weren’t making scientifically-false claims. We also checked for user reviews and any dermatologist approvals or study results. We even used our own experiences!</p><h3>Best Overall: Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cellulite-treatments-brazilian-bum-bum-cream.jpg><p>This caffeine-rich cream is famous for its delicious scent and skin-smoothing properties.
