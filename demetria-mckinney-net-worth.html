She rose to fame as an actress and singer, starring in the TV comedy sitcom “House of Payne” (2006-2012), which was created by the director and producer <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a>. Her career in entertainment industry has been active since 2000.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Demetria McKinney is? According to sources it is estimated that her total net worth is $3 million, an amount earned mostly through her career as an actress, however, McKinney has also tested her singing talents, releasing a number of singles that have also effected her net worth.</p><h3>Demetria Mckinney Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>McKinney`s childhood was marked by frequent migrations, as her father was a member of the US Military. Before she become popular, she attended Fort Walton Beach High School in Florida. Her professional career didn`t start until 2004, however, McKinney had been developing her talent since her early days, as she had been involved in church choirs, and she continued to develop her skills as she earned vocal scholarship and studied theatre and dance.</p><p>Her first notable role was as Kim Brown in the play “Meet the Browns”, written by <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a>, with whom McKinney continued working through the next few years, appearing in several plays and television shows he produced and directed, including “What`s Done in the Dark”, “Why Did I Get Married” and her most notable role as Janine Shelton-Payne in the comedy sitcom “House of Payne”. This role earned her a nomination for Best Performance in a Comedy, and certainly improved her net worth. Her most recent involvement on television includes appearance in the 7th season of the show “The Real Housewives of Atlanta”.</p><p>As her fame grew, so did her career as an actress. She expanded her talents to the big screen, appearing in films “Daddy`s Little Girls” – again a collaboration with <a href=#>Tyler Perry</a> – and “In the Meantime” among others, considerably increasing her net worth.</p><p>Beside her acting career on television and in films, McKinney has also been involved in theatre, as she has appeared on Broadway in the musicals “I Dream” (2010) and “Dream girls” (2012).</p><p>Overall, her career is rather successful, as she has appeared in more than 20 television and film titles, “Necessary Roughness”, “The Rickey Smile Show”, “Breaking up Is Hard To Do” and many others that have also contributed to her net worth.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, McKinney has also tried herself as a singer, and she has been represented in the R&B scene since 2011. The singles such as “Get Yo..Ish”, “Take Away This Love”, “Work With me” and other have become one more source of her net worth. During her career as a singer, she has collaborated with artists such as Anthony David, <a href=#>Musiq Soulchild</a>, <a href=#>R. Kelly</a> and others. She has also released her first EP entitled “Officially Yours”, in order to promote her which, McKinney has released music videos for the songs “Trade it All”, “100” and “Work With Me”.</p><p>Regarding her personal life and interests, McKinney is apparently dating TV producer Roger M. Bobb, who she met while on the “House of Payne” set, but the couple didn`t come out in public until the end of the show, because of <a href=#>Tyler Perry`s</a> affection towards McKinney. However, Demetria has stated that music is her first love, and that the EP is just a beginning, with the world yet to hear her talent.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=18.661122661123><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Demetria McKinney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 27, 1979</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fort Walton Beach, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Songwriter, Model, Singer, Dancer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Fort Walton Beach High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Roger M.
