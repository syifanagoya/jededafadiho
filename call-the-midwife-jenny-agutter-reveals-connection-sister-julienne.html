She said would I like to meet, and I did."&nbsp;</p><p id=eUR-oAmKhqlu data-wc=71>"She was <strong>wonderful</strong>, and she wrote out notes for me about her aunt and the way she was. It was great. Although one can’t replicate the character, it was lovely to know that she wanted to honour that, and I took many of these aspects of the way that she seemed to be, because in truth, being a nun is completely outside anything I could imagine for myself," she said, laughing.</p><p id=ehfSQBA6W9AC data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Call the Midwife's Helen George teases 'deeply emotional' relationship in season 11</a></strong></p><p id=enUm5KmkHmSC data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Call the Midwife star teases how 'unpredictable' Miriam Margolyes returns to the show</a></strong></p><p id=ei99_Q5T2RZ4 data-wc=13>"So, one hangs onto anything that is real, that one knows," Jenny added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b7fb5d3c046-call-the-midwife-s11-turner-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebMMolasjXQL data-wc=11><strong>Jenny Agutter teases new challenges for Nonnatus House in series 11</strong></p><p id=e-zmysCBT6l5 data-wc=32>The latest series of the much-loved BBC drama returned to our screens last week and viewers can expect to see Nonnatus House face a whole new set of challenges, according to Jenny.&nbsp;</p><p id=erEATcORcgKW data-wc=42>Speaking at a recent press event, she teased the new series.
