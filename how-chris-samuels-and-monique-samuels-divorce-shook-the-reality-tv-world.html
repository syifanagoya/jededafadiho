However, after an 11-year marriage, the former NFL player and Real Housewives of Potomac alum decided to part ways. What led to their separation, and how did it impact their lives and careers? Here’s a glimpse into the rise and fall of their relationship and their current endeavors.</p><h2><strong>The Beginning of a Love Story</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Chris and Monique first crossed paths at a mutual friend’s birthday party. Their connection was immediate, leading to a swift romance. They became engaged in 2011 and exchanged vows in a lavish ceremony at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C., in March 2012. The couple welcomed three children, Christopher in 2013, Milani in 2015, and Chase in 2019, while also settling into a $4.9 million mansion in Potomac, Maryland.</p><h2><strong>Reality TV Stardom</strong></h2><p>Entering the reality TV scene in 2016 with The Real Housewives of Potomac, Chris and Monique quickly became fan favorites. Their glamorous lifestyle, strong bond, and witty personalities endeared them to audiences. They also featured on Love and Marriage: D.C., a 2020 show on OWN that delved into the lives of four couples juggling careers, marriages, and families.</p><h2><strong>The Trouble in Paradise</strong></h2><p>Despite their public image, Chris and Monique faced challenges in their marriage behind the scenes. Marital issues surfaced around 2017, leading to their separation in 2020. Although they kept the split private until 2021, reports suggest differing visions for the future and communication breakdowns contributed to their decision to part ways.</p><p>Monique, sharing her journey in a July 2021 Instagram Live session, disclosed undergoing therapy and realizing her dissatisfaction with the marriage after evaluating her needs and Chris’s ability to meet them. Ultimately, she chose to end the marriage for the sake of her happiness and to set a healthier example for their children.</p><h2><strong>The Amicable Divorce</strong></h2><p>Despite their divorce becoming final in September 2021, Chris and Monique maintained a civil and respectful relationship. They continued to support each other in parenting and publicly acknowledged each other’s achievements. The divorce documents remain sealed, but the judge approved the judgment, according to PEOPLE.</p><h2><strong>The New Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Post-divorce, both Chris and Monique have embraced new chapters in their lives. Monique focuses on her podcast, Not For Lazy Moms, and launched Mila Eve Essentials, an essential oils line named after her daughter. Chris continues coaching football and has ventured into the music industry with releases like “Love You More” and “Never Give Up.”</p><p>Both have found new love interests—Monique with businessman and philanthropist Kevin, and Chris with singer-songwriter Ashley. They’ve introduced their new partners to fans and their children, expressing happiness and mutual support. Despite their separation, they emphasize friendship and committed co-parenting.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Chris and Monique’s divorce, though surprising for fans, showcased maturity and courage. They chose a respectful and peaceful end to their marriage, prioritizing their happiness, dreams, and dedication to co-parenting their children. While no longer a couple, they remain a family in the truest sense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63LpaqhnV6YvK57x6iuZpuYp7a0edKapK6dnKh6orrDZqSoppmmwqZ50pqkrp2cqHqltdWoqZydXai1sLvKZquhnV2nsqK4yK2wZqymYsSwvsudZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
