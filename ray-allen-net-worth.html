Vince Carter’s net worth is roughly $110 Million.</p><p>Vince Carter is an American former professional NBA player.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter is the only player in NBA history to play 22 seasons; the only player to play in four different decades.</p><p>He was one of the oldest active NBA players until he announced his retirement in 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vincent Lamar Carter was born on the 26th of January, 1977, in Florida.</p><p>Carter is the son of Vince and Michelle Carter.</p><p>His parents divorced when he was only seven years old, following which his mother, a school teacher, remarried Harry Robinson, also a school teacher.</p><p>Young Carter was equally talented in music and sports and was encouraged by his mother and stepfather to pursue both to have a well-rounded upbringing.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vince Carter was originally drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the 1998 NBA Draft but was traded for <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/antawn-jamison-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148465 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Antawn Jamison</u></a> to the Toronto Raptors.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter proved to be instrumental in helping the Raptors make their first playoff appearance in 2000, and he earned the Rookie of the Year award.&nbsp;</p><p>By his second season, he had become an NBA superstar, and at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, he led one of the most memorable Slam Dunk Contests.&nbsp;</p><p>During his third season, he averaged 27.6 points per game and was made a starter in the 2001 NBA All-Star Game.&nbsp;</p><h3>An NBA Leader</h3><p>In August 2001, Vince Carter signed a six-year contract extension for $94 million but missed 22 games that season due to injury.&nbsp;</p><p>However, soon after, Carter joined <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/charles-barkley-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148466 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Charles Barkley</u></a> as the second player to ever finish with 15 rebounds, 15 rebounds, five assists, and five steals.&nbsp;</p><p>While he was voted to the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, he missed out due to requiring surgery, and the following season only played 43 games.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2003, Carter gave up his place in the All-Star Game to <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/michael-jordan-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148467 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Michael Jordan</u></a>, allowing the legend to make his final start as an All-Star.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the Raptors’ new general manager traded Carter to the New Jersey Nets, and he quickly became hated by Toronto fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, he didn’t let this bring him down, and during the 2005 season, he helped the Nets to the second round of the playoffs.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Nets, The Magic, And The Suns</h3><p>During the 2006-07 season, Carter and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/jason-kidd-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148468 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Jason Kidd</u></a> became the first team to record triple-doubles in the same game since <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/scottie-pippen-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148469 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Scottie Pippen</u></a> and Michael Jordan.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, he re-signed with the Nets for four years and $61.8 million, and in the 2008-09 season, he was made the captain of the Nets.&nbsp;</p><p>After recording his fifth triple-double in 2009, in June, he was traded with Ryan Anderson to the Orlando Magic, where he scored a season-high 48 points in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the year, he helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals and, the following season, was traded to the Phoenix Suns.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Suns, he reached 20,000 career points and became the 37th NBA player to reach that threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after the NBA Lockout, Carter was waived by the Suns, having appeared in 51 games with 41 starts.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Mavericks, Grizzlies, And The Kings</h3><p>Vince Carter signed a three-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 and reunited with his former teammate Jason Kidd.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Mavericks, Carter became known for his three-pointers and passed <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/larry-bird-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148470 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Larry Bird</u></a> on the NBA’s career scoring list.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2014, he had raised his total career points to 23,010 and became the 27th player to pass the 23,000 mark.&nbsp;</p><p>Later that year, he signed a multi-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies but appeared in only one of the first 12 games of the 2015-16 season.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, he won the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for his leadership both on and off the court.&nbsp;</p><p>The following season, Carter played his 1,278th game and became the 24th player to surpass 24,000 points.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, he signed a one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings and was named the Most Influential Veteran by the NBA Players Association.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the season, he also earned the NBPA’s Backbone Award and its Most Respected Award at the Players Voice Awards.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Atlanta Hawks</h3><p>Following his year with the Kings, Vince Carter signed with the Atlanta Hawks and made his debut against the Knicks in October 2018.</p><p>At this point, he was the second-oldest player in NBA history to start at 41 years and 264 days old.</p><p>Later, he became the oldest player in NBA history to score 20+ points, breaking <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/kareem-abdul-jabbar-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148471 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s</u></a> record.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2019, he <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/06/05/vince-carter-announces-retirement/1360206001/ data-lasso-id=148472 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>planned to retire</u></a> at the end of the season, re-signing for one year with the Hawks.&nbsp;</p><p>By December, he became the fifth player in history to play 1,500 games and the only player to have played in four different decades.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter played his final game on March 11, 2020, against the New York Knicks, making his last three-pointer during the final seconds of the match.&nbsp;</p><p>He officially announced his retirement on June 25, 2020, and went on to sign with ESPN as an NBA and college basketball analyst.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section

Carter</strong></p><p>“I think people are going to like my new shoes.
