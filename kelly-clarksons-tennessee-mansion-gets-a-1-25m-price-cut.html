As a result, TMZ reports that the asking price of the house has been slashed by more than a million dollars, bringing it down to $7.5 million.</p><p>That's $1.25 million less than the house's original asking price when it was listed in March 2017. As for the property itself, it's generously proportioned at four acres against the area's Old Hickory Lake, located about 25 miles outside of Nashville. The house, which Clarkson reportedly bought back in 2012, boasts seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms (plus three half-baths), and a master suite complete with fireplace, among other impressive amenities.</p><p>Those amenities, stacked on the mansion's three levels, include a western-themed "saloon"-style bar, gym, rec room with table tennis, and a home office that occupies two stories – with a private elevator to get between the two.</p><p>Outside, you'll find a traditional long drive leading to a large fountain with a saltwater swimming pool out back. That's in addition to not just one but two separate spas, a garden, greenhouse, an outdoor dining area, and a private dock.</p><p>Interestingly, the home's official listing actually mentions Clarkson, which may be a sign of how eager she is to sell it:</p><p><strong>"Kelly Clarkson is selling her stunning home on an exclusive four+ acre gated waterfront estate! Home is naturally light and airy, with magnificent views from every window. Quiet wooded cul-de-sac, private dock, saltwater pool, two spas… so much more!</strong></p><p>You can take a look at Kelly Clarkson's Tennessee castle in the slideshow below, courtesy of Showcase Photographers:</p><p></p><p>If you like what you see, now's your chance to snap the property up at a discount of more than a million bucks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGebmrmtxYyco5qqm6i8r7%2BMrZynppWowKaxjKaYp6uZpLtus8StqmaZXWZ6c4HMZqeroZOaeqTB02g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
