He is currently the host of CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman, which has been on air since 1993.The Indiana native got his start as a local TV anchor and weatherman in Indianapolis. In 1975, he moved to Los Angeles where he performed standup comedy and caught the attention of scouts from NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He quickly became a favorite of Carsonls, which earned him a regular guest spot on the show in 1978.
