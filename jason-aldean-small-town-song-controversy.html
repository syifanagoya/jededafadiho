The video was for a ballad called Try That in a Small Town, which the 46-year-old singer explained in his posts was about the declining sense of community and respect in modern America. “I hope my new music video helps y’all know that u are not alone in feeling that way. Go check it out! [sic]” wrote&nbsp;Aldean.</p><p>But the video was much more. It comprised footage of clashes between protestors and police, of Molotov cocktails being lit and of shops being robbed by men in balaclavas. “Stomp on the flag and light it up/ Yeah, you think you’re tough/ Well, try that in a small town,” sings&nbsp;Aldean. “See how far you make it down the road/ Around here, we take care of our own.” The message in the lyrics was clear: protest all you like in the city, but break the law in small town America at your peril. We’ll get you.&nbsp;</p><p>The most shocking thing about the video, however, was the footage of the Stetson-wearing&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;and his bandmates performing the song. They’re filmed in front of Maury County Courthouse in Tennessee, the site of the 1927 lynching of a black man called Henry Choate. The video immediately took on racial connotations, with some observers accusing&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;of releasing a pro-lynching song. Country Music Television (CMT) banned the video (without explanation). Outrage ensued.&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;hit back, saying that not a single lyric in the song references race. He called the accusations of racism “not only meritless, but dangerous”.</p><p>So far, so grim. The argument depressingly encapsulates the increasingly brutal and brutish culture wars of our times. But the controversy only tells half the story. In a stark example that the law of unintended consequences is alive and well in the music industry, Try That In A Small Town has become a massive hit as a result of the row. This week it reached number two in the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Streams of the song have risen by 999 per cent from 987,000 to 11.7 million in a matter of days, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The video has been watched 18 million times on YouTube, up from 350,000 when CMT banned it a week ago. And the song is currently at number 26 in the UK charts –&nbsp;Aldean’s only single to reach the Top 40 in this country.</p><p>Small Town has become more than just a song. It’s now a lightning rod for the Left and the Right. And the more each side tries to shout the other side down, the bigger the song gets. It’s a politically-charged sonic snowball. And you thought music was about three chords and the truth.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/b1_RKu-ESCY/mqdefault.jpg alt="tmg.video.placeholder.alt b1_RKu-ESCY" width=800 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Right-wing politicians have piled in to defend&nbsp;Aldean. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted: “The Left is now more concerned about&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;Aldean’s song calling out looters and criminals than they are about stopping looters and criminals.” South Dakota’s Republican governor Kristi Noem said she was “shocked” by people “attempting to cancel this song and cancel&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;and his beliefs”. William Lamberth, Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, told his Twitter followers that “the woke mob will hate you for liking this song”. Even former President Donald Trump weighed in. “Jason&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;is a fantastic guy who just came out with a great new song. Support&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;all the way. MAGA!!!” Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform.</p><p>Others have taken&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;to task with equal force. Shannon Watts, founder of public safety advocacy group Moms Demands, pointed out that the singer appears to be encouraging gun violence when he was the musician on-stage during the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history (Aldean&nbsp;was performing at the Las Vegas concert in 2017 where 60 people were killed by gunman Stephen Paddock –&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;escaped unharmed). Meanwhile TikTok user Destinee Stark refuted&nbsp;Aldean’s claim that his video only contained “real news footage”. She found that two of the clips came from stock footage, including a snippet of a protest in Ukraine in 2013, some 5,000 miles from US shores. When Stark posted her own video containing her findings, she herself was the subject of racist slurs, including one threat to hang her in a backyard.</p><p>Detractors have embraced humour too. A photograph of Trump kissing&nbsp;Aldean’s wife Brittany Kerr on the forehead in a restaurant, with&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;looking on, has gone viral. “Do men get cucked [cuckolded] in a small town?” wrote one wag.</p><p>Even the country music world is tearing itself apart over&nbsp;Aldean’s track. Sheryl Crow laid into the singer. “I’m from a small town. Even people in small towns are sick of violence… This is not American or small town-like. It’s just lame,” Crow wrote.</p><p>There is, of course, only one winner in all this:&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;Aldean. Throughout his career,&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;has always juxtaposed his small-town way of life with the brashness of big city life. While the former is honest and uncomplicated, the latter is brazen and ostentatious. His debut single Hicktown in 2005 contrasted the “Martini bars” and “fancy foreign cars” of the folks in the city with beer bought from petrol stations and the simple pleasure of listening to country music radio. Hicktown sold a million copies in the US. This latest controversy is Hicktown on steroids.</p><p>It would not, of course, be too cynical to suggest that&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;has deliberately manufactured all this. He’s a clever businessman. As well as releasing ten albums and 40 singles, he has his own Bourbon brand (Wolf Moon), his own restaurant in Nashville, and sells a merchandise range that includes branded beach towels and picnic blankets. It’s no coincidence that his most recent concert tour kicked off in Bethel, New York, the day that the Small Town video was released.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>American musician Sheryl Crow has waded into the debate</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Terence Patrick/CBS via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Perhaps&nbsp;Aldean&nbsp;has been studying the history books. Outrage has a habit of backfiring in the music industry to the benefit of the artist in question. In 2021 country singer Morgan Wallen allegedly used a racist slur – and his album sales surged. In popular culture, fury stokes interest. When Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was banned by the BBC for its indecent content in 1984, it went to number one for five weeks. Likewise when radio stations and most high street retailers banned the Sex Pistols’ anti-monarchist anthem God Save the Queen in 1977, it went to number two in the charts (rumours suggested that only coordinated underhand tactics by the industry prevented it from topping the charts).</p><p>The internet, YouTube and social media merely supercharge this fury as they <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>make viewing and commenting on contentious content easy</a>. The context is totally different but earlier this year non-binary singer Sam Smith released a suggestive video for their song I’m Not Here to Make Friends. The video was set at a sexually-charged house party and featured Smith in a low corset, nipple pasties and a glittery codpiece. It lit a similar culture wars tinderbox among the commentariat (gender identity versus moral panic). The upshot? It was watched 5.5 million times in eight days.</p><p>The video for Try That in a Small Town and the polarised uproar that has followed its release prove that we live in divided, nasty and worrying times. But perhaps more than anything, the video proves that controversy – along with beach towels, picnic rugs and Bourbon – always sells.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKWlqLake8Crq6KrpKh8q63SqKVmmZyZsqK6jKykmqScYsGww81mqqiml2KwsLrTq6avnaKoxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
